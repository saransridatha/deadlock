## Features
- User-friendly Graphical User Interface(GUI).
- Input for the number of processes and resources.
- Entry fields for allocation matrix, request matrix, and available vector.
- Detection of deadlocks with a safe sequence if applicable.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3 (or later)
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
